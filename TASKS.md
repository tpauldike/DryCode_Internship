# `Python` Development Internship
*Complete AT LEAST ONE TASK from the list of tasks given under your internship function. After that, you can do as many tasks as you want for learning & LoR.*

## Desktop Assistant
Companies in the technology industry prefer individuals that can utilize limited resources and create Python projects with them. Creating a desktop assistant
and adding it to your resume shows a hiring manager your analytical skills. You can make a desktop assistant with a few Python packages. A Python package is a
collection of closely related modules. During the creation of the desktop assistant, you may ensure that each package adds a feature to the assistant.

## Contact List
As old school as it may sound, creating a contact list, adding contacts along with phone numbers or emails, and editing them, are still prevalent. To create one,
you can use the SQLAlchemy library which uses SQLite to store contacts. Your contact book application should be organized into modules and packages, and you
should give it a coherent structure.

In order to get the most out of this project, some previous experience with `Python` and `PyQt` programming would be helpful.

As a result, you will need to know the following:
- Develop GUI applications with `PyQt` and `Python`
- Use `Python` and `PyQt` to manage `SQL` databases
- Working with `SQLite` databases

## Monty Hall Simulation Problem
Monty hall’s problem comes from a famous movie where three doors are used to help you win a car. How? Each door hides something behind it - a car and two goats.
Any door can have the car while the remaining two have goats. The probability to find a car is 1⁄3. Now, if you select Door 1 and the host opens Door 3 to find
a goat, your chances just become 2⁄3. This program will help you solve this problem.
